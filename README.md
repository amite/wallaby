# Wallaby ('cause counter apps are boring ðŸ™„)

An open source wallet app for learning React + Redux

This is an intermediate level React project that covers topics and techniques that help you build apps that scale:

1. Creating custom components using Css in Js techniques with Glamorous 
2. Refactoring large monolithic Dom into small flexible components
3. Updating state using functional setState api
4. Handling immutable updates for state using plain ES6 
5. Moving business logic out into testable pure functions
6. Splitting application container state for better management and updates
7. Updating nested state without mutations
8. Creating separated service layers that update state for UI, Api (just logic), and Http (ajax calls)
9. Minimizing, controlling and refactoring state 
10. Using custom components from the eco system for date-pickers and notifications
11. Working with forms in React including basic validations
12. Setting up a fake data server using json-server
13. Making api calls the right way with async/await
14. Creating a custom list view as a child component using data sorted by date with moment.js
15. Analysing and Optimizing React rendering using `why-did-you-update`, PureComponent and the `pure` module for stateless functional components from Recompose
16. Testing basics with Jest
17. A look at different scalable application patterns for organizing your enterprise domain in React
18. Create your own starter kit with webpack for react + redux (basic level)
19. A look at React Boilerplate for scalable configuration patterns for large projects

Interactive exercises with your trainer (me) will include:

1. Buildling a basic layout by refactoring html into small components
2. Integrating Css in Js with Glamorous
3. Add and refactoring state for your React app
4. Building your own Api modules for UI, Api (just logic), and Http (ajax calls)
5. Updating nested state using immutable patterns
6. Setting up fake data and database with a json-server
7. Building a form component with custom input components
8. Writing pure functions that can be tested easily
9. Making api calls with async/await
10. ...And more ðŸ˜ƒ

This course assumes a certain level of comfort with:

1. Arrow functions  ({ size = â€˜smallâ€™ }) => ({ width: size === 'small' ? '80%' : '90%' })
2. Dynamic object keys
3. De-structuring Assignment: Array De-structuring
4. De-structuring Assignment: Object De-structuring
5. Using the Spread operator to merge objects and arrays ([â€¦state, id: newState.id]) 
6. Default parameters
7. Object.assign 
8. Complex ternary expressions -4
9. Class level property syntax (arrow function this binding inside es6 classes)
10. ES6 classes - constructors, getters and setters
11. Promises
12. Async/Await 
13. Template literals
